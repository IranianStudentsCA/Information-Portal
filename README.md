**NewComers Program** is an annual and statewide effort initiated by ISC, in collaboration with local Iranian Student Organizations (ISOs), to warmly welcome incoming students of Iranian heritage, domestic or international. ISC’s primary role in this program is to support local student organizations by providing planning, communication,  outreach, experience, and financial resources. 

## This is a Campaign!
One of our main goals in this annual campaign is to highlight the importance of welcoming new students of Iranian heritage within the broader community of the Iranian diaspora. We hope to enhance connections between the student body and the Iranian community by involving alumni, professors, community members, and various nonprofit organizations. We intend to shine light on the challenges that our new students encounter to encourage widespread support.

## About ISC's Information Portal 
Unfortunately, one of the challenges of our community is the relatively limited access to information. The multi-phased “Information Portal” project was developed to: 
* Provide our NewComers from Iran with the necessary information to help them transition through immigration to the US. 
* Serve as a hub to enhance the connection of our community, to better introduce local student organizations and communities on each campus to its NewComers. 
* Improve the accessibility of services provided to students by many Iranian-American nonprofits, such as scholarships, financial-aids, legal consults, and other charity activities.
